# Wellness Challenge

Turing sponsors a Wellness Challenge each week to encourage healthy habits for students while in school. Prizes are given at the end of each week as well as the end of each mod.  

This is a desktop application to replace the Google spreadsheet that students fill in each day. By creating a better user interface the hope is to encourage a higher rate of participation by students.
